	This folder contains sample JSON data for use in testing the interface
to CRF++.  It contains data that has been scraped from Web sites, tokenized,
and annotated for hair and eye color.  A single record may contain multiple
English sentences.  These files do not contain "features" as produced by
crf_features.

	The text in these files may include Unicode codes, encoded using
UTF-8.  HTML entities (e.g., "<u>", "<br>") may appear in the text fields of
these examples, and are converted to HTML escapes for when tokenized (e.g.,
"&lt;br&gt;" and "&lt;u&gt;".
